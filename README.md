# tdd-talk
Examples used in my Unit Testing/TDD talk.

### Example1
Very simple example just to show how to setup and run tests using JUnit.

### Example2
A slightly more complicated solution showing why some classes are hard to test and how to solve such problems.

### Example3
Empty project used for live demo of TDD.

## Run/build
These are gradle-projects. Any descent IDE with Gradle support (IntelliJ IDEA for example) should be able to import them.
